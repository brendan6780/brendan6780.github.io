<h1>My Personal Profile</h1>
<p><i><b>Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Test:</i></b> ISFJ-T (Defender) (NERIS Analytics 2019)</p>
<p><i><b>Learning Style Test:</i></b> Equal parts visual and read/write (VARK Learn 2019)</p>
<p><i><b>Big Five Personality Test:</i></b> Conscientious and Agreeable (Truity 2017)</p>
<p>Interestingly, the results of the above tests are not mutually exclusive. The Myers-Briggs test defines my personality type as “Defender” which subscribes well to the “conscientious” and “agreeable” traits of the Big Five Personality test (Truity 2017). The “Defender” type is an eclectic mix of sensitivity and conservativeness, analytical skills and dedication (NERIS Analytics 2019).</p>
<p>While initially dismissive of the value of these tools, I believe they have correctly defined myself as a student, team member and colleague. As described by these tests (NERIS Analytics 2019; Truity 2017), I am an organised and determined person and prefer to cooperate with others rather than compete, as this tactic helps to avoid conflict which in turn halts progress. I prefer to break apart tasks into components for completion, use these to set goals at the beginning of a project, and work towards their completion systematically and on-time. This also allows me to better understand the requirements of the task at hand as it appeals to my visual/read/write learning style. Having an inherent sensitivity to the requirements of others during project work helps to prevent conflict, as you can identify issues early, work with (or around) them, and complete the task at hand. This dedication to projects and desire to complete tasks to the best of my ability is the basic definition of conscientious, but does however mean I have a hard time saying no to requests for help from team members, which can lead to overburdening at times.</p>
<p>My approach to teamwork is influenced by my desire to break down tasks into pieces and set goals for completion. For example, splitting reports into paragraphs, assigning to team members, and having drafts ready for swapping at set times. I am most comfortable in a team that can identify ‘micro-goals’ for each team member and work efficiently towards their completion on a set timeline as I can be assured that the project will be completed on time. As such, in teams that don’t subscribe to this method of planning or where team members don’t all complete goals on time, I begin to doubt whether the project will finish on time, or to the quality I anticipated. In the past when this has occurred, I’ve undertaken substantial editing myself to align all ‘micro-goals’ to one standard.</p>
<p>When forming teams, I look for like-minded individuals who are open to this method of working towards ‘micro-goals’. I don’t however look for people exactly the same as me, as multiple similar personalities tend to produce conflict in group work, which as previously mentioned I prefer to avoid. When forming groups for the first time it’s difficult to assess how group members will function over time, so I would be dishonest in guaranteeing the previously mentioned requirement for editing does not occur in future team environments, however I have found that closely monitoring the progress of each team member and providing help and feedback to them (which in turns lends itself to reciprocation) throughout the course of the project better helps each individual, including myself, to achieve their set goals. There is a fine line between this and micro-managing, but in terms of reaching goals it’s a line worth walking. </p>
