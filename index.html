<h1>My Profile</h1>
<p><b>About me, and my interest in IT</b><p>
<p>Hi, my name is Brendan and Iâ€™m studying a Bachelor of Information Technology with RMIT, through Open Universities Australia. My passion has always been in helping others, so I chose an initial career path in the medical sector and have been working in this field since graduating with my first degree. While this career has been rewarding and I love being able to help people in this way, I have realised that there are other ways I can contribute to society and help people (perhaps in a less direct fashion) while working in a field that is much more progressive, and that I have found interesting since I was very young.</p>
