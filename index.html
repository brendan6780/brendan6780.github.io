<h1>My Profile</h1>
<p><b>About me, and my interest in IT</b><p>
<p>Hi, my name is Brendan and I’m studying a Bachelor of Information Technology with RMIT, through Open Universities Australia. My passion has always been in helping others, so I chose an initial career path in the medical sector and have been working in this field since graduating with my first degree. While this career has been rewarding and I love being able to help people in this way, I have realised that there are other ways I can contribute to society and help people (perhaps in a less direct fashion) while working in a field that is much more progressive, and that I have found interesting since I was very young.</p>
<p>I’m the type of person you need to get to know, to really know me. I grew up on property about half an hour from town with pretty limited access to technology. This was the driver for my interest in IT, especially in all things telecommunications; I didn’t have access to basic broadband so I wanted to know all about it, to figure out why this was the case. There was no mobile phone service, so I researched mobile frequencies, tower locations and external antennas to see if I could overcome this. Theory started going into play after the switch to digital TV occurred in 2013, and the only digital service we could receive was polarised differently to our council-run analogue TV, and came from further away. Living on property means you don’t call someone to fix things if you can do it yourself – so when analogue was switched off, I installed a new TV antenna and masthead amplifier, positioning and polarising it myself with a compass and map. After that came installation of a yagi mobile phone antenna, an interest in point-to-point farm communications, and the list goes on.</p>
<p>Moving into the ‘big smoke’ and starting a biomedical degree caused this passion to hit the backburner for a while, but it’s back at the forefront now that I have enrolled at RMIT. There is a University much closer to me that offers a very similar course, however my partner will be studying in Melbourne in 2020, so we are moving to Victoria at the end of 2019. As such I decided to study at RMIT, partially because I could get a head start online now, and partially because my research concluded that it offered the best IT course of all Universities in the Melbourne area.</p>
<p>At the beginning of a bachelors’ course, I believe expectations of future learning should be very loose. If you expect to learn only certain things you’ll either find yourself disappointed this did not occur, or homing in only on those things and missing other equally important content along the way. Study plan requirements often mean you study subjects you wouldn’t normally choose, and therefore learn things you would never have learnt if you could pick and choose according to expectations of learning. So while I’m going to be tailoring my studies to networking (how networks work, their setup, maintenance and expansion), I am open to learning anything and everything else along the way.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
