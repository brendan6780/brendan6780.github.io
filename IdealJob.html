<h1>My Ideal Job</h1>
<p>My ideal position involves working in a Network Operations Centre as this provides a great mix of fast paced work, problem solving and exposure to different hardware-software mixes.</p>
<p><i><b>Ideal position:</i></b> IP NOC Engineer</p>
<p><i><b>Seek advertisement link:</i></b>  <a href="https://bit.ly/2W6X0CY" target="_blank">https://bit.ly/2W6X0CY</a> | <a href="TPGIP_NOC_Engineer_SeekAd.png" target="_blank">(Screenshot)</a></p>
<p>This Network Operations Centre (NOC) Engineer role involves network monitoring and traffic management, fault rectification and network provisioning throughout the entire TPG IP network. The inherent requirement of this position is an ability to problem solve in a fast-paced environment, work to timeframes and liaise with vendors and other NOC staff; the prospect of which I find exciting. Tasks include responding to network faults and trouble tickets, assisting in planned outages and network upgrades, using network monitoring tools to maintain oversight of various elements of the TPG IP network, and working with hardware and technology vendors in relation to network faults, performance and monitoring.</p>
<p>As with all job advertisements, this position requires that successful applicants demonstrate qualifications, skills and experience prior to employment. At this point in my study it’s understandable that I am lacking in the qualifications and experience inherent to this position, however breaking down the requirements of the position allows for an understanding of which requirements I can already demonstrate, which I need to work towards meeting, and how I will work towards meeting these requirements.</p>
<h2>Qualifications:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Tertiary-level study of IT, Telecommunications, or an Engineering degree related to IT/Telecommunications</li>
<li>Cisco Systems certification: CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate), and CCNP (Cisco Certified Network Professional)</li>
</ul>
<p>I currently hold none of the required qualifications, however I have planned my degree around the attainment of these. Completion of my Bachelor of Information Technology with a minor in Cisco Systems (comprising of Networking 1 and 2, and Advanced Networking 1 and 2) will fulfil both the tertiary study requirement and the requirement for CCNA and CCNP certification, which I plan to attain through the Cisco Systems minor.</p>
<h2>Skills:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ability to function both in a team and autonomously, multitask and work under pressure
<ul>
<li>Strong organisational, analytical and problem solving skills, and the development of strong interpersonal relationships are inherent to the requirement of these abilities, and to the position itself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Excellent written and verbal communication skills</li>
<li>Ability to conceptualise systems comprised of people, processes and technologies</li>
<li>Thoroughness and attention to detail</li>
</ul>
<p>Previous study and employment has helped me to fulfil many of these skills already, and future study through the Bachelor of IT will further develop these skills. Thoroughness and attention to detail, as well as excellent written and verbal communication skills were paramount in my previous position as a lack of these skills could jeopardise patient safety. Similarly, development of strong interpersonal relationships came almost automatically when working with teams of medical professionals. Organisational, analytical and problem solving skills were introduced to me during my first University degree, albeit tailored to the medical field, and I anticipate that the Bachelor of IT will help me to focus these towards the requirements of this field. Likewise, I anticipate that my current understanding of IT systems will be bolstered by my study, which will allow me to better conceptualise systems comprised of people, processes and technologies.</p>
<h2>Experience</h2>
<ul>
<li>Prior experience in a telco environment with exposure to network management, equipment configuration and fault resolution
<ul>
<li>Which in turn provides the requisite general IP knowledge, including of routers, switches, networks and various IP protocols, and an understanding of various VPN technologies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ability to use Visio and the Microsoft Office suite</li>
</ul>
<p>Experience requirements will always be the crux of a job application. While I have gained experience with the Microsoft Office suite (including Visio), I currently have no experience in a telco environment. The best place to start would be a position in an Internet Service Provider's first-tier support team, which requires a fraction of the knowledge and experience outlined in this position. From here, I would gain proficiency in fault resolution, and at least basic experience in network management and configuration, and would be able to more effectively “slip in” to the advertised role.</p>
